# Adult Mods Backup

This repository serves as a mirror of 513 adult‑content mods originally hosted on Nexus Mods. The full archive is 13 GB in size and is stored on Mega; no explicit media files are hosted or embedded here.

## Download

## Details

All 513 mods are provided as individual compressed files. Each archive includes its own installation instructions. This backup was created in response to Nexus Mods’ recent acquisition by Chosen, which may lead to age‑verification measures or removal of adult content for UK and EU users.

## Usage

Open the Mega link in your browser, browse or search for the mod you wish to install, download the corresponding archive, and follow the install guide contained within each file.

### FrostyToolsuite

The most advanced modding platform for games running on DICE's Frostbite game engine.
Download: https://github.com/CadeEvs/FrostyToolsuite/releases/download/v1.0.6.3/FrostyModManager.zip

#### Setup

1. Download Git https://git-scm.com/download/win.  
2. Create an empty folder, go inside it, right click an empty space and hit "Git Bash Here". That should open up a command prompt.  
3. Press the green "Code" button in the repository and copy the text under "HTTPS".  
4. Type out `git clone -b 1.0.6 <HTTPS code>` in the command prompt and hit enter. This should clone the project files into the folder.  
5. Open the solution (found under FrostyEditor) with Visual Studio 2019, and make sure the project is set to DeveloperDebug and x64. Close out of retarget window if prompted.  
6. Only build the projects themselves, never the solution.
