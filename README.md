## Why This Exists

Nexus Mods was recently acquired by Chosen, a company focused on growth and monetization of gaming startups. In their own words:

> As a business, this leaves us with a choice:  
>  
> Remove adult content for all UK and EU‑based users.  
> Make adjustments to our policy, including adding age verification for some adult content.  
>  
> Adult content is a core part of what makes Nexus Mods what it is; we don’t consider removing it a viable option. We are aware that some users may find the changes irritating; however, we are obligated to do this to ensure we can continue to host adult content legally.

To safeguard against potential removal or loss of media, this repository was created as a community‑driven backup.
